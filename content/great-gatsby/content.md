## Summary
The Great Gatsby tells the story of eccentric millionaire Jay Gatsby and his obsession with the beautiful Daisy Buchanan. Set in the Roaring Twenties, the novel explores themes of wealth, class, love, and the American Dream.

## My Thoughts
I found Fitzgerald's writing to be elegant and evocative, perfectly capturing the Jazz Age's extravagance and emptiness. Gatsby is a fascinating character whose tragic flaws make him both sympathetic and frustrating.

## What I Liked
- The vivid descriptions of lavish parties
- The complex, flawed characters
- The beautiful, poetic prose
- The exploration of the darker side of the American Dream

## What I Didn't Like
- Some secondary characters felt underdeveloped
- The pacing slowed in the middle sections

## Favorite Quotes

> "I hope she'll be a fool -- that's the best thing a girl can be in this world, a beautiful little fool."
