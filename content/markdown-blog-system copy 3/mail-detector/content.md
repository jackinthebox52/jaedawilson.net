# Technical Implementation

The Mail Detector system uses a combination of deep learning and computer vision techniques to achieve high-accuracy detection of delivery vehicles. The system is built on Python and TensorFlow, using a custom-trained YOLOv5 model.

## Core Features

- Real-time detection of USPS, UPS, FedEx, and Amazon delivery vehicles
- Custom-trained convolutional neural network achieving 94% accuracy
- Instant notifications via SMS or email when deliveries are detected
- Support for multiple camera feeds with GPU acceleration
- Web dashboard for monitoring and historical delivery tracking
- Low latency processing (under 100ms per frame)

## Model Architecture

The detection pipeline uses a modified YOLOv5 architecture with the following improvements:

```python
def process_frame(frame):
    # Preprocess frame
    processed = preprocess_image(frame)
    
    # Run detection
    detections = model.predict(processed)
    
    # Filter and process results
    vehicles = post_process_detections(detections)
    
    # Trigger notifications if needed
    if vehicles:
        send_notification(vehicles)
    
    return vehicles
```

## Results & Impact

The system has been successfully deployed at multiple residential locations, demonstrating:

- 94% detection accuracy in varying weather conditions
- Reduced missed deliveries by 75%
- Average notification time under 5 seconds
- False positive rate below 1%

## Future Development

Ongoing development focuses on:

1. Integration with smart home systems
2. Enhanced night-time detection capabilities
3. Support for package tracking integration
4. Mobile app development for easier monitoring
